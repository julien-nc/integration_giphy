# Giphy integration in Nextcloud

This app adds:
* A search provider for GIFs
* A link reference provider to render links to GIFs in Talk and Text
* A custom link picker to get GIF links

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Admin settings

There is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section if you want to set your own Giphy API key instead of the default one.
The default one has a very large quota and should be fine.
